Welcome to my 2D Platformer project  
**This project is currently under development...**  
I used the raylib game library to develop it in C.  

My goal with this particular project is the learn the basics of game architecture along with how things work in C language and working with makefiles.

## Quickstart
Currently, the makefile is written to build for windows and linux. It detects the operating system automatically.
> MacOS support is on the way..

### Windows
Enter the following command in the project directory:
```bash
make run
```

### Linux
Run the following in your terminal (inside project directory):
```bash
make run
```
